        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>6 ounces tomato basil feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
    
            <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 pieces of waxed paper. Gently pound chicken with flat 
                side of meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4 inch thick; remove wax paper. Place 
                1 ounce of feta cheese in the center of each chicken breast, and fold in half.</li>
        
            <li>Spread 2 tablespoons bread crumbs in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange 
                chicken in the dish, and top with remaining bread crumbs.</li>
            
            <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer 
                pink and juices run clear.</li>
